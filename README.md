# Omega_web
A no-fluff, clean personal portfolio built with React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. It showcases my projects, skills, and contact info — basically, everything a recruiter or client needs to know about me.   It's a full React app that uses routing, dynamic content, and clean component architecture — built to actually show what I can do.
